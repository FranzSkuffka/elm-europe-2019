# VeePee

- 400 devs
- little elm experience

- PoC in hackathon went to prod

# Dojo
- every friday
- attracting people from outside dev. That is support for example
- boosting less confident devs
- mentors are key to spread elm

Elm as learning tool - funnel to haskell backend


# Process
- Two teams on greenfield
- Two teams moving from react to elm


# In practice
- elm enforces KISS
- a more verbose solution may be simpler because it reduces cognitive load
- Feature-based structure
  - views are an exception

# Haskell as a backend
- encode / decode stuff automatically
- guarantee that things are in sync
- context switchign is easy
- drawback - elm-bridge in 0.19 was hard to find

- backend was nodejs
- GraphQL introduced
- F# introduced

# Pitfalls
- performance > lazy everywhere
- gc overload = algorithm too complex
- lack of components - filterable tabs for example
- documentation between 0.18 and 0.19
- time travel debugger is not too got
- package manager

# Recrutigin
Manager: can u find elm devs
Me: did u find react devs
manager: ...
me: more people willing to change to fp jobs than fp jobs
Manager: aha
